IPL Cricket Squad Selection

This project aims to create an efficient and data-driven system for selecting cricket squads for the Indian Premier League (IPL) based on various performance metrics, player statistics, and team composition strategies. The system leverages machine learning models to predict and recommend the optimal team lineup, maximizing the chances of success based on historical data and real-time performance trends.

Objectives

Data-Driven Squad Selection: Analyze player performance, pitch conditions, and opposition strengths to make informed decisions for squad selection.
Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms (such as XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) to predict player performance and recommend squad members for different match conditions.
Team Composition Strategy: Focus on balancing key player types like batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders while considering factors like form, fitness, and previous performance.
Dynamic Player Tracking: Continuously update player stats, injury reports, and form updates to keep the squad selection process aligned with real-world changes.
